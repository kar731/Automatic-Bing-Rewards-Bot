# Automatic-Bing-Rewards-Bot
This bot will automatically launch a firefox process, sign into bing, then launch an automatic bing rewards searcher.

Requirements:    
Python 35 (not tested on other versions)    
selenium | pip install selenium

TODO:   
Possibly make it so it doesnt create a new profile everytime. Can't fix that.    
Make it compatible with Chrome.
